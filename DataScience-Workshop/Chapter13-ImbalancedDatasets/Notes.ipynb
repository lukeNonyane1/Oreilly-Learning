    "## Challenges of Imbalanced Datasets\n",
    "As seen from the classifier example, one of the biggest challenges with imbalanced datasets is the bias toward the majority class, which ended up being 88% in the previous example. This will result in suboptimal results. However, what makes such cases even more challenging is the deceptive nature of results if the right metric is not used.\n",

    "Let's take, for example, a dataset where the negative class is around 99% and the positive class is 1% (as in a use case where a rare disease has to be detected, for instance). "

    "In many circumstances, collecting more data, especially from minority classes, can be challenging as data points for the minority class will be very minimal. In such circumstances, we need to adopt different strategies to work with our constraints and still strive to balance our dataset. One effective strategy is to resample our dataset to make the dataset more balanced. Resampling would mean taking samples from the available dataset to create a new dataset, thereby making the new dataset balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind resampling is to randomly pick samples from the majority class to make the final dataset more balanced.\n",
    "### Generating Synthetic Samples\n",
    "In the previous section, we looked at the undersampling method, where we downsized the majority class to make the dataset balanced. However, when undersampling, we reduced the size of the dataset. In many circumstances, downsizing the dataset can have adverse effects on the predictive power of the classifier. An effective way to counter the downsizing of the dataset is to oversample the minority class. Oversampling is done by generating new synthetic data points similar to those of the minority class, thereby balancing the dataset.\n",

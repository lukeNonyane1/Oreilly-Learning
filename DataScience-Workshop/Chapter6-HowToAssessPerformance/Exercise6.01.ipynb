The absolute distance is the distance regardless of the sign, whether positive or negative. For example, if the ground truth is 6 and you predict 5, the distance is 1. However, if you predict 7, the distance becomes -1. The absolute distance, without taking the signs into consideration, is 1 in both cases. This is called the magnitude. The MAE is computed by summing all of the magnitudes and dividing by the number of observations.\n",

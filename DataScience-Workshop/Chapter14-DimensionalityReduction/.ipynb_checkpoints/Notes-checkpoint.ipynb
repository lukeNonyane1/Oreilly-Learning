    "### Backward Feature Elimination (Recursive Feature Elimination)\n",
    "The mechanism behind the backward feature elimination algorithm is the recursive elimination of features and building a model on those features that remain after all the elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take the case of the original dataset we had, which had 1,558 features. The algorithm starts off with all the 1,558 features in the first iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, we remove one feature at a time and train a model with the remaining n-1 features. This process is repeated n times. For example, we first remove feature 1 and then fit a model using all the remaining 1,557 variables. In the next iteration, we use feature 1 and instead, we eliminate feature 2 and then fit the model. This process is repeated n times (1,558) times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the models fitted, the performance of the model (using measures such as accuracy) is calculated.\n",
    "The feature whose replacement has resulted in the smallest change in performance is removed permanently and Step 2 is repeated with n-1 features.\n",
    "The process is then repeated with n-2 features and so on.\n",
    "The algorithm keeps on eliminating features until the threshold number of features we require is reached."

    "    -Once the first feature is selected, it is the time to select the second feature. The process for selecting the second feature proceeds exactly the same as step 2. The remaining n-1 features are iterated along with the first feature and the performance on the model is observed. The feature that produces the biggest improvement in model performance is selected as the second feature.\n",
    "    -The iteration of features will continue until a threshold number of features we have determined is extracted.\n",
